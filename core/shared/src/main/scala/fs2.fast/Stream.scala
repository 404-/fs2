/**
 * A stream producing output of type `O` and which may evaluate `F`
 * effects. If `F` is `Nothing` or `[[fs2.Pure]]`, the stream is pure.
 *
 * Laws (using infix syntax):
 *
 * `append` forms a monoid in conjunction with `empty`:
 *   - `empty append s == s` and `s append empty == s`.
 *   - `(s1 append s2) append s3 == s1 append (s2 append s3)`
 *
 * And `push` is consistent with using `append` to prepend a single chunk:
 *   - `push(c)(s) == chunk(c) append s`
 *
 * `fail` propagates until being caught by `onError`:
 *   - `fail(e) onError h == h(e)`
 *   - `fail(e) append s == fail(e)`
 *   - `fail(e) flatMap f == fail(e)`
 *
 * `Stream` forms a monad with `emit` and `flatMap`:
 *   - `emit >=> f == f` (left identity)
 *   - `f >=> emit === f` (right identity - note weaker equality notion here)
 *   - `(f >=> g) >=> h == f >=> (g >=> h)` (associativity)
 *  where `emit(a)` is defined as `chunk(Chunk.singleton(a)) and
 *  `f >=> g` is defined as `a => a flatMap f flatMap g`
 *
 * The monad is the list-style sequencing monad:
 *   - `(a append b) flatMap f == (a flatMap f) append (b flatMap f)`
 *   - `empty flatMap f == empty`
 *
 * '''Technical notes'''
 *
 * ''Note:'' since the chunk structure of the stream is observable, and
 * `s flatMap (emit)` produces a stream of singleton chunks,
 * the right identity law uses a weaker notion of equality, `===` which
 * normalizes both sides with respect to chunk structure:
 *
 *   `(s1 === s2) = normalize(s1) == normalize(s2)`
 *   where `==` is full equality
 *   (`a == b` iff `f(a)` is identical to `f(b)` for all `f`)
 *
 * `normalize(s)` can be defined as `s.repeatPull(_.echo1)`, which just
 * produces a singly-chunked stream from any input stream `s`.
 *
 * ''Note:'' For efficiency `[[Stream.map]]` function operates on an entire
 * chunk at a time and preserves chunk structure, which differs from
 * the `map` derived from the monad (`s map f == s flatMap (f andThen emit)`)
 * which would produce singleton chunks. In particular, if `f` throws errors, the
 * chunked version will fail on the first ''chunk'' with an error, while
 * the unchunked version will fail on the first ''element'' with an error.
 * Exceptions in pure code like this are strongly discouraged.
